This module will set process titles of httpd processes to request names they're
currently processing, so they will be visible in top and ps. Useful for site
debugging purposes.

The following configuration options are available:
ProctitileEnable - On/Off (Enable/disable module)
ProctitleUriSep - the separator string used to separate URI from state
                  ("::" by default)
